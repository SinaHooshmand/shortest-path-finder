Pathfinding Algorithms in Python
This repository contains implementations of two popular pathfinding algorithms: A* and Dijkstra’s algorithm. Both algorithms are used to find the shortest path in a graph, which can represent road networks, game maps, or other navigational structures. The implementations utilize the OSMnx library to retrieve road network data for Tehran, Iran.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement and visualize pathfinding algorithms using real-world data. The road network of Tehran is used as a test case, allowing users to see how each algorithm performs in finding the shortest path between two coordinates.

Algorithms
A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to a goal node in a graph. It uses heuristics to guide its search, which can significantly improve performance compared to uninformed algorithms.

Key Features:
Utilizes a heuristic function (Euclidean distance) to estimate the cost to reach the goal.
Maintains a priority queue to explore the most promising paths first.
Returns the shortest path and its total distance.
Code Snippet:
python
def a_star(graph, start, goal):
    # Implementation details...
Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph. It explores all possible paths equally, making it simple but sometimes less efficient than A*.

Key Features:
Computes the shortest path to all nodes from a single source.
Uses a priority queue to manage nodes being explored.
Returns the shortest path and its total distance.
Code Snippet:
python
def dijkstra(graph, V, source_index):
    # Implementation details...
Installation
To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
pip install osmnx networkx numpy folium
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-algorithms.git
cd pathfinding-algorithms
Run the A* algorithm:

python
python a_star.py
Run the Dijkstra algorithm:

python
python dijkstra.py
Open the generated map.html file in your web browser to visualize the shortest path.

Results
After running the algorithms, you will see the shortest path plotted on an interactive map of Tehran. The total distance of the path will also be printed in the console.
